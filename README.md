The game is set in space where the player is in a spaceship trying to shoot a UFO (the enemy). The player gains points passively as time passes but the enemy will become faster and shoot more frequently as the game goes on.  This game is inspired by Galactica when I played it as a kid.

Controls
To move, the player can use WASD or arrow keys. Spacebar to shoot
